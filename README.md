This main aim of the project is to show what all the features that we need to know to create a react application and why do we need those features. 
As a first step i have created a index.html file where all the begineers will be excited to see their code working in the browser.
Added npm package for react. gitignore
Convert the index.html code to react code
We use import to use react and react dom. The browser doesnt know the ES6 language. To make it work we use a bundler where we can compile all type of files.
Bundler - webpack comes into picture.
